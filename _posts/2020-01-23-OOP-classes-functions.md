Though I've been keeping up on the work and the information I'm learning in class is mostly review (albeit review of stuff I haven't touched in 5 years...), I'm still *exhausted!* The pace of the class in addition to preparing elevator pitches, touching up my linkedin page, and trying to make it out to meetups is intense! I feel like every part of my life is focused on this one goal. I need some time to just star at the wall! 

Needless to say, I felt like I was still asleep for the first half of class. Brian introduced the main principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) today and then segwayed into talking about classes. We learned 3 fundamental principles of OOP:
	1. Encapsulation - hiding functionality behind and easy to use interface
	2. Inheritence - classes that are descendants of other classes attain attributes and behaviors of ancestors
	3. Polymorphism - code should be able to take many forms, such that we can treat it like its ancestor class and still get a specific response

All of these principles, we will be going over in more detail in <del>weeks</del> days to come. 

We practiced creating a simple class and then using it to build a Rectangle object in our main program. A few takeways: 
	* classes should be nouns
	* their data members should be private and accessed through getters and setters
	* their methods should be verbs that do a thing

More to come on classes too. 

## Okay so about that meetup at root I attended last night: 

Root's space is industrial-modern and they brought in catered Piada and local beers for the guests. The topic of the meetup was Data Goverance and using data visualization to increase compliance. Though it seemed like most people there were data analysts, anything related to managing big data is interesting to me. I had no frame of reference when tools like tableu or viz were mentioned, but in general I was able to understand the main points of the talk. 

Unlike the first meetup I went to, I fought through the discomfort and met more than ten people. I talked a lot to Root employees about what it was like to work for a small startup in Columbus and spoke to others working in the data industry about machine learning and the untapped value of swaths of data already collected. Overall, I felt like attending this event was highly valueable in terms of connections and information about working with data.
