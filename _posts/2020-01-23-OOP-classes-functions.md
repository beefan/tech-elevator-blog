Okay so about that meetup at root I attended last night: 
Root's space is industrial-modern and they brought in catered Piada and local beers for the guests. The topic of the meetup was Data Goverance and using data visualization to increase compliance. Though it seemed like most people there were data analysts, anything related to managing big data is interesting to me. I had no frame of reference when tools like tableu or viz were mentioned, but in general I was able to understand the main points of the talk. 

Unlike the first meetup I went to, I fought through the discomfort and met more than ten people. I talked a lot to Root employees about what it was like to work for a small startup in Columbus and spoke to others working in the data industry about machine learning and the untapped value of swaths of data already collected. Overall, I felt like attending this event was highly valueable in terms of connections and information about working with data.
