Today in class we built part of a vending machine application to review for our capstone program. We spent a lot of time focusing on the design: making a list of things we need to do, grouping them into categories, and designing classes to handle each category. This really helped to cement the design concepts we've been learning over the past days.

After class we had a pathway event in which the instructors from the other classes taught us about what kind of projects might be realistic to undertake as side projects, how to tell stories about things we work on outside of Tech Elevator, and also what roles we might be applying for. 

Immediately after the pathway event I held a workshop to help some students through the completion of my lightning talk from last week (building a free website with github pages). A handful of students came and two of them left with a working website on their own custom domain! Wasn't able to fix everyone's problems but I still considered the workshop a success.
