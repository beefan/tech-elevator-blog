title: Day 30 Capstone 2, Day 2
summary: The second day of the second capstone project was today. Completed most of our Database Access Objects. Got most of our menu done, most of our tests too. There is still a lot left to go. We'll be working over the weekend.

Today started off finishing the remaining database access objects for our reservation system. We already had one that accessed the venue table. Now, we have one that accesses the reservation table and one that accesses the space table. 

We wrote tests for our new DAOs and this took quite a while. Writing the tests showed us that our queries were a little too simplistic. We spent hours tweaking the queries and asking classmates for assistance, but we finally got it.

One of the fun things about this capstone has been the camaraderie in the classroom. Everyone has been leaning on one another here and there, asking questions and taking little breaks to joke around. It has made the whole project feel more collaborative though we all have very different approaches to solving the problems. 

We spent some time on our menu today too. Most of the menu prompts required to ship our minimum viable product are completed. The bonus requirements are another story. 

We still have a lot of work left to do, but it's kind of hard to predict exactly how many hours of work. We'll go in tomorrow with the goal to finish by the end of the day. 

Around lunch time, we had a recruiter panel. Representatives from Amazon, Upstart, and Beam Dental all came to talk about their experiences interviewing techincal candidates. Before the panel, it was time for my group to give their Elevator pitches for the second time. The words left my mouth much more smoothly than before and it was over quickly. 

It was awesome to hear a little more about the various interview processes, get advice on how to ask questions, and learn what makes candidates stand out. I'm nervous to start technical interviews, but eager to get started soon.
