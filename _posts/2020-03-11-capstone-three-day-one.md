title: Day 43 Capstone 3 Day One!
summary: Module 3 is almost over! Today we started the third capstone project, a full stack web application for National Park hobbyists.  
---

Today was the first day of Capstone 3. As usual, Brian spent the first hour or so going over the details. This time he also picked teams on the fly. The basic requirements for this applications are pretty simple, but this is the first application we have built that won't have a command line interface. At the end of the project our app will show a list of parks from a database, allow users to get details about a specific park (including weather info), and allow users to submit a review that will save to the database.

Simple app, but the functionality will put everything we have learned in module three to the test. We'll have to wire up the database, define the controller, create the view pages, store user preferences in session scope, practice the POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern, practice user validation, and store information to the database. Then we have to go back and make everything look pretty with CSS. Oh, and I forgot to mention testing. 

So yeah, even though the objective is quite simple, meeting that objective will draw on everything we've learned. Today we got the database models and interfaces created, implemented the interfaces into our data access objects, and then wrote integration tests for the database access layer. After that, we got our home page populated with National Parks and some info about them and started working on the park detail page. 

Lots more to do tomorrow.
