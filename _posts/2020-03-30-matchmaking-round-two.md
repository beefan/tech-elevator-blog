title: Day 56 Matchmaking Round Two
summary: Today was our second and final round of Matchmaking. I met with three companies for virtual interviews. 
---
We started off the last week of classes without class. It was the second day of Matchmaking!

I met with:
* Veeva Systems
* Everest Technologies
* Base22

I was nervous before the day began. I spent my morning going through LinkedIn profiles and company websites to prepare. From last Matchmaking, I felt pretty comfortable in the process. The lack of non-verbal expression in remote interviews scared me a lot at first. Sometimes, the audio is distorted enough that you can't even make out those small verbal fluctuations that add subtext to phone conversations. Today however, it felt comfortable. Every interview I had was relaxed and felt more like a natural conversation. I guess we are all getting used to remote work.

For the discretion of the companies I met with and also for my job search, I don't want to get into too many details here. What I will say is that the Pathway team at Tech Elevator made this process extremely smooth. Not only did they organize an event where we get to interiew 6 companies in two weeks, but on a whim they changed the entire structure of it. Though going all virtual truly sent me into a panic, I am satisfied with the exposure I got to real world interviews and the connections I made with companies I met.
