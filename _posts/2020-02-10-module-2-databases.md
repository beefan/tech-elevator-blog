title: Day 21 Module 2 Begins! 
description: Today was the first day of the second module. 
summary: And so, module 2 begins! Introduction to databases, SQL queries, postgres. We are done touching java for a while as we investigate the world of data.

In class today, we started with a quiz over module 1. The quiz took about thirty minutes but it wasn't too difficult. The day felt light and fluffy compared to the chaotic and fast-paced end of last week. No more java for a while. No more eclipse. No more new programming syntax...for now. 

We spent a while takling about SQL and various other database solutions invented by companies like Facebook (Cassandra) and Amazon (Dynamo DB) when SQL no longer fit their needs. In this class, we won't have any special data needs that challenge the limitations of SQL, so we will stick to SQL or Structured Query Language.

Most of the day was administrative. Brian spent some time introducing the tools we will be using to learn relational databases: Postgres and DbVisualizer. Then, we spent some time learning how to construct basic queries. Quickly, I realized that I learned basic SQL when I interned at IBM (Looking back, their internship was extremely well structured and thorough, a mini bootcamp on its own). Needless to say, the introductory assignment did more to jog my memory than it did to challenge me. Looking forward to learning more in this module! 

#### Pathway: 
After class, we had a pathway event where Vinny detailed the benefits of LinkedIn and gave us some tips on best practices to make good connections and rank high with recruiters. I'm not a fan of social networks in general and it seems problematic to me that LinkedIn membership (crafting and organizing your own employment data for sale) is more or less compulsory in today's professional climate but . . .that's outside the scope of this blog. If you gotta play the game, might as well play to win right? By the way, have we connected on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-fannin/)?
