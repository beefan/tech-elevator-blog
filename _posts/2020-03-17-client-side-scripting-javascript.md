title: Day 47 Client Side Scripting, Javascript, Remote Technical Interviews
summary: Today we introduced javascript. We also had our second techincal interview. This time, remote (and with a volunteer outside of Tech Elevator)!

We used javascript for Tech Elevator's pre-work (11 weeks ago now...) so this is not my our first time working with javascript. However, we seem to be approaching it as if it's all new. Today we went through some language specific semantics, discussed where to put js files, how to import them into our html, and how javascript is like/unlike Java. 

There's a lot of semantics I won't go over here, but I do want to note what I feel to be the biggest takeaways from today's lecture. Javascript is: 
* Based on C so syntax is satisfyingly similar to Java
* An interpreted language (not compiled) which means it is dynamically compiled at runtime by the web browser VM. 
* Dynamically typed - so the language infers the datatype of variables based on the value it holds

There are other things, like arrays not being confined to specific datatype, objects being defined in a block with key, value pairs, and === equality vs. == but I won't spend time on these here.

#### Technical Mock Interview 
Today was our second techincal mock interview. This time, held by someone outside of Tech Elevator. We also had the joy of doing it remote (on our second day of remote work, mind you!). Needless to say, I was an anxious mess for this interview. I am still really uncomfortable with working virtually and it would be one thing if the only thing changing was remote work! Everything around us is rapidly changing and adjusting to the "new normal" of life under coronavirus while also adjusting to remote work while also preparing for a technical interview is just too much. 

For the most part, I held my composure but when I stumbled on a few questions, I felt myself getting emotional. I presented as cold and unemotional as a consequence of trying to hold back how overwhelmed I actually was. The interviewer gave me some good feedback which included showing vulnerability and moving my desk so that I had better lighting on my face. Make no mistake, I was not excited to be doing a remote interview this soon into the "new normal" and I don't reckon showing how I actually felt would have fared well either. 

In any case, I am adjusting. One step closer to being myself behind a webcam. Which is good because at this rate, I might even start a new job without ever meeting anyone in person!
