title: Day 46 Remote Learning and API Endpoints
summary: From this point on, we are going all remote! Today we learned about API endpoints and had a pathway event that kicked off the job search.

So, because of Covid-19 Tech Elevator is going full remote. We will be doing lecture and pathway events through Zoom for the next three weeks at least. Since there are only four more weeks in the cohort, it's foreseable that we will finish the cohort remote.

It's going to take a while to get used to working remote. It was hard to pay attention in lecture. Learning this way is not for me, but for four weeks it is going to have to work. 

We learned about API endpoints today. Essentially, API endpoints are urls within your web application that return data or take data. API are also sometimes referred to as web services. Just as a database has create, read, update, delete (CRUD) methods, we typically write APIs for post, get, put, and delete which map 1to1 to our database CRUD methods. 

SOAP APIs are secure apis which return xml data. Mostly people use REST APIs now and that is what we are going to use for this cohort. These return JSON objects which are simple and easy to create. 

We define our APIs in the Controller where we previously mapped the JSP pages for the server to respond with. We covered how to specifically write spring annotations on the controller in java so that our application responds correctly. Brian also showed us how to use the app Postman to see if our APIs are working and Swagger to automatically generate documentation. 

In the near future, we will use these APIs to make javascript front ends instead of JSP pages. 

#### Pathway
After class we had a pathway event where Ben and Vinny covered some general tips for interviewing and applying for jobs. Starting now, we are to reply to 3-10 jobs per week. After we apply, we are to find recruiters on LinkedIn and reach out to show our interest. I've been applying since last week and have several applications outstanding as well as 2 rejections already. 

Next week, we have matchmaking (which will also be all virtual!) and tomorrow we are going to get a peek at what companies we'll have to honor to meet with. The job search is the scariest part of the program so far, but persistence is key. It was relieving to hear all the pathway directors say that despite Covid-19, no employers are cancelling on matchmaking. Working remote in the tech industry is relatively easy to do and not only are companies ready for it, they are ready to continue with their hiring schedule.
