The first day of anything new is anxiety-ridden. Tech Elevator is a fast-pace coding bootcamp taking those with little to no coding experience and turning them into junior developers. It's hard to know exactly what's in store, but one thing for sure: a lot of work is soon to follow. 

Today was relatively low key--the calm before the storm. We started the day with orientation, talked about the structure of the program, and then split into our classes. There are 56 students and 3 classes. I am part of the Java Blue Cohort being taught by Brian. 

Brian covered the basic tools we will be using in class, an intro into the BASH shell, and an intro into using GIT.
