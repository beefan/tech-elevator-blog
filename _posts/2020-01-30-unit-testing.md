title: Day 14 Unit Testing
description: We spent all of class talking about testing.
summary: Testing is a complicated facet of software development. Today we covered unit testing in detail and wrote some unit tests ourselves. We also learned developers are terrible testers.

Challenging day in the classroom. Brian went into detail about the testing cycle of a software product. Mainly:
* Requirements - does our product meet business/consumer specs?
* Architecture - how well integrated are the various components of our software?
* Design - does our product meet design specs? Is it user friendly?
* Construction - unit testing; does our code do what it's supposed to.

Some testing is done manually, usually more subjective tests such as user experience. A lot of testing is automated. Some of this is implemented in unit tests by the developer, but an entire team of testers usually exists as well called Quality Assurance (QA). 

For now, we focusing on writing unit tests for our own code. Later on in the cohort, we will actually write tests before we write code practicing what is called Test Driven Development. Testing is tedious and I already loathe doing it. Though besides the tedium, it is not too difficult. 

## Meetup
I stayed at Tech Elevator for a long time working on unit tests with my partner for the pair programming exercises, but afterwards many of us went to a meetup at ScriptDrop called Columbus Tech EI (emotional intelligence). They held a panel on **Embracing I Don't Know** and the panelist had some great insight on fighting imposter syndrome and feeling empowered in asking for help. 

I met several people from Script Drop as well as several bootcamp students at WeCanCodeIt. The place were emotional intelligence intersects with technical intelligence is where I am excited about going with my career and this was a great meetup to attend as it signalled that I am not alone in this interest!
