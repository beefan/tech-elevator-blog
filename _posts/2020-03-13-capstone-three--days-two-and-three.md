title: Day 44 & 45 Capstone 3, Days 2 and 3 
summary: JSP pages, CSS, and Selenium Testing! Didn't do much other than work on this project so I'm combining the last two days into one post.

Today and yesterday have kind of blurred together so I'm blurring the posts together too. Referring to commit messages to seperate acheivements by day.

Capstone 3, Day 2: 
* Created a worker class. Abstracted data access functionality behind methods in that class. Added class to generate recommendations based on weather. 
* Completed the park detail page and survey page. 
* CSS for home page, survey page.  

Capstone 3, Day 3:
* Replaced default images for parks and weather and logo.
* CSS for park detail page, header/footer.
* Implemented option for user to change temperature units. 
* Testing for models and worker class
* Selenium testing. 

We will come in on Saturday and work for a few hours finishing up Selenium testing and talking about presentation, but for the most part our National Park web application is completed! 

This project felt less stressful than some of the other projects though it still took a lot of our time. It was cool to see all of the different parts we've learned so far come together. 

The parts I enjoyed the most were solving problems like dynamically calculating the temperature and changing CSS based on user unit selection. The solution involved work in the controller, jsp page, and the css. 

The parts I liked the least were spending hours changing just the css page tring to get minor details to line up to the pixel. It's easy to lose way to much time obsessing over these details and miss out on larger functionality.
