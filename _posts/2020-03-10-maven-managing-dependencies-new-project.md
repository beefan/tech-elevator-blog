title: Day 41 Maven and Starting a New Project
summary: Today we covered creating new Maven projects and managing dependencies. Illness kept me from an employer showcase and a review. 
---

Maven is a build tool, but also a dependency management tool. Brian showed us how we can outline our dependencies in the `pom.xml` file in order to have maven go out and fetch the necessary jars to run our project. 

To build a full stack web project like we've been working with the last week, we need to add the `javax-servlet-api`, `jstl`, and `spring-web-mvc`. We then need to define the dispatcher servlet and servlet mapping in the `web.xml`. Then define beans, datasource, base package, and the view resolver in the `spring-servlet.xml`. 

Luckily, we rarely need to do these things without guidance. We can use structures called **archetypes** which are pre-defined project starting points. Tech Elevator has defined a few for us to use in our upcoming capstone. 

#### Pathway
The National Registry of EMT's came to Tech Elevator today, but I skipped out. 

There is fear growing all around us about the novel coronavirus. Ohio just landed its first three cases and Ohio State just cancelled in-person classes until April. In the wake us this scare, I have a sore throat and full-body fatigue. No fever, but better safe than sorry.

I didn't feel comfortable bringing whatever sickness I have into a crowded room for the employer showcase so I left to go home, drink tea, and rest.

Brian held a course review this afternoon in preparation of an upcoming three-day capstone project. I skipped this to rest as well.
