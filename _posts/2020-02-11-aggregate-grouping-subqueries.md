title: Day 22 Aggregate Functions, Grouping, & Subqueries
description: Today we learned about aggregate functions, grouping, and subqueries
summary: Today was another introductory day to SQL. We learned about aggregate functions, grouping, numeric operations, and subqueries. Nothing too crazy.

Not much to add for today's post. We covered aggregate functions in SQL (things like avg(), sum(), min(), and max()) as well as grouping and subqueries. Using "GROUP BY" in our SQL queries allows us to perform aggregate functions on specific groupings of data. Using subqueries allows us to return a single column of data from one table and then use that to query another table. We also learned about how to use numeric operators and concatenate strings. Compared to java, SQL is more intuitive. Still, we aren't really doing much yet. Just learning the ropes.

#### Pathway: 
After class, we had a pathway event focused on networking. Ben gave us some tips for networking and once again emphasized the importance of getting out there and meeting people in the industry. He sat us in groups and handed out a sheet of paper with *some* information about each other but missing names and previous job experience. The goal was to perform as if we were at a networking event and gracefully work ourselves into finding out the answers about each other. This was a fun exercise, and I learned a lot about people I've been learning alongide for four weeks now.
