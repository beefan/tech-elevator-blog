Today was a fun day learning about CSS selectors and designing the visual side of our future web application. This is not a new topic to me and I've spent tens of hours googling how to do various things in CSS while working on my own websites. Still it was great to--for the first time--get an official lesson and learn things I'd never learn without Tech Elevator. (Like, don't use CSS ids for more than one html element)

In class we used CSS to make a simple page mimic trello's user interface. CSS frustrates me greatly because it always seems like it takes a long time to accomplish relatively simple objectives but once you complete the design of something it feels good. Writing this as I have just finished up the exercises for the evening--designing a Tech Elevator homepage according to an image file--and feeling satisfied with the work. 

I'm excited to integrate this lesson with java and database stuff to finally move beyond the command line user interface. 

Right after lunch, we had a pathway event called Interviewing 101. Ben quite candidly detailed how to prepare for interviews, what not to do, and how to realistically frame our employement quest in our own minds. We are heading into mock behavioral interviews this week and before we know it, technical interviews. It's important to feel confident and not take rejections too seriously from this point forward.
