title: Day 29 Capstone 2, Day 1
summary: We started our second capstone project today. We are making a venue reservation system to practice interacting with a database in Java.

Brian spent the first hour or so going over the capstone requirements and showing us the schema of the provided database. After that, Martha and I got started on design. We used Lucid Chart to get a rough design underway: ![capstoneplan]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/Capstone2Diagram.png "Our second capstone project design") 

We made a document of all of our classes and filled in most of the methods we believed they would contain. Overall it seems like this capstone project is simpler in design than the first one, and its uniqueness is encapsulated in the fact that we have to practice our newly learned database connectivity skills. 

Martha and I decided to go no later than 6pm both Thursday and Friday in order to save a little of our sanity. We might have to come in Saturday for a little while, but at least we won't be stuck here Friday evening until 8 with code starting to look like a foreign language. More tomorrow on substance. 

#### Employer Showcase:
Our day was broken up by an Employer Showcase from Olive. They shared a presentation about their culture and what they are doing. The company looked interesting, and surely they are providing value to the healthcare industry, but I'm unsure if I would be a good cultural fit. It was still awesome to have them come in and present their company to us.
