title: Day 12 More on Polymorphism
description: Today's lesson focused on Polymorphism. 
summary: Today we talked about polymorphism and interfaces. We made a FarmAnimal interface to demonstrate and implemented it in some different Farm Animals. Resume Building and Lightning Talks in the afternoon.

*What is my code doing?*

That felt like the question of the day. Transitioning into Object Oriented Programming and talking about objects and inheritence and ya ya ya is difficult, even for those of us with prior experience. We went from typing code and running code using simple loops and conditional statements. "OK, code does things," we thought.

*What is my code doing?*

Well. . .nothing until you create a main program and then initialize your new classes as Objects. Hmm? 

Brian was very thorough in going through the FarmAnimal example today and implementing it in Cow, Chicken, Sheep, etc. He showed us how to build an interface that is a "contract of the methods that a class must have" and how each class can have multiple. We worked through a Milkable interface and a Singable interface, implementing different functionality in the Farm Animals. It all seemed to make sense. . . until we got to our exercises. 

Today we had pair exercises and individual exercises. Though both have been challenging, the individual exercises are throwing me for a loop! (pun intended). I am enjoying the challenge, but it does make my head spin to try and understand when to create an interface and when (if?) we should create superclasses. 

#### Pathway: 
Besides these new fun challenges, we also had a pathway presentation on building killer resumes. Ben presented some incredibly helpful information regarding best practices on resume building. I feel prepared to take my resume from a 4.5 to at least an 8. 

#### Lightning Talks: 
And after the pathway event, we had our first round of lightning talks. I gave a talk on building a blog using Github Pages. This blog is built and served using Github Pages! I got the idea to give a presentation on it because on day 1 of the cohort I was contemplating building a blog and built this one during lecture! It was that easy. Seeing that building a personal brand is a big part of the Tech Elevator program, I was excited to share how with others how easy it could be to create a landing page for yourself.
