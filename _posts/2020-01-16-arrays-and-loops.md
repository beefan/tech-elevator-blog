Not mentioned in my post from yesterday is that I had a meeting with Katie to discuss my strengths from the strengths finder quiz. She asked me to make a list of all my programming related accomplishments as a way to visualize how much programming experience I actually have. When pressed, I remembered the first programs I ever wrote were in TI Basic when I was a sophomore in high school. (later I found them [here](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/106/10631.html)) Programming has been a part of my life since before I even started thinking about a career. It's always been a fascinating way to approach solving complex problems. 

This is all to say that today was another easy day. Besides my calculator programs, I've also written bash scripts in linux, java web applications at IBM, android software at Methode Electronics, and the list goes on. . . Even in the recent years I spent "not doing any programming at all", I fantasized about software solutions to automate record keeping that cuts into the profits of small farmers, made blogs, and learned git. 

I'm familiar with java. I'm familiar with eclipse. I've written complex methods and worked on teams collaborating with other software developers. It's been easy to fear the intensity of Tech Elevator, especially after orientation outlined just how fast we were going to move. But, I'm quickly realizing that basic programming skills are hardwired into my brain already. Which means the first couple weeks are going to be less challenging than I imagined. 

**After class,** we got some professional headshots done to add to our linkedin profiles. Perhaps more than programming, networking skills and the skill to tell my personal story confidently to total strangers is what I seek to gain from Tech Elevator. I've already been reminded that I can do the work. Believing in myself and my ability to connect with others is the next step.
