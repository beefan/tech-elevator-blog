title: Day 16 Error Handling & Reading Files
description: Today we covered error handling and reading files.
summary: Today's class was on handling exceptions in java code and reading files. We also practiced encapsulation, spliting our I/O class into a menu, a file reader, and a main program.

This weekend I didn't do any coding. I had the opportunity to go to a mycology class in Harrisburg, PA taught by Alan Rockefeller. Though I didn't realize it at the time, this guy is a pretty big deal in mycology circles. We learned how to extract DNA and replicate a portion of it for sequencing. Amazing workshop, but it led to me falling behind in my Tech Elevator work.

Being behind was on my mind throughout the whole lecture. We learned about catching exceptions and reading files. I wanted to work ahead, but needed to focus on the material Brian was teaching. We're learning things I haven't done much in the past. Brian walked us through a simple example which read a text file and printed the number of lines specified by the user. We modeled a design pattern which isolates System I/O and business logic from the main program. I followed along, eager to get to my exercises. 

After class, I put headphones in and poured myself into Eclipse. I finished the homework I'd put off over the weekend as well as the individual exercises practicing reading files. Whew! I didn't did started on the pair exercises for tomorrow, but I feel much less stressed about being behind.
